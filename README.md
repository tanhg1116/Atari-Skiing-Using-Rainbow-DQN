# Undergraduate-Y3S2-Atari-Skiing-Using-Deep-Q-Network-Rainbow
Author: Ng Zheng Jue, Ng Rui Qi, Ong Ming Jie, Tan Hong Guan

* This is a project developed in undergraduate Year 3 - Semester 2
* This repository consists of solving a control movement problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The deep learning architecture used is Deep Q network that trained using Rainbow as we are dealing with the deterministic action
* At the same time, we analyze the effect of applying imitation learning in the Atari Skiing problem, the demonstration can be shown at [youtube]
* This repository consists of
Jupyter Notebook file to extract the environment, process the environment, build the deep learning model, control movement using deep learning model
